The goal of this project is to provide a responsive webapp for creating CSS styles.
Major goals include:
-Allowing users to see a specified HTML element with different styles applied
-Allowing users to create styles without writing any CSS
-Allowing users to save CSS styles (by name) from the browser
-A comfortable interface for doing all of this

The current (very informal) to-do list is below:

create border style option
create border radius style option
set view text
UI padding
export CSS
save and name style settings
style settings don't reset when one is deleted
remove style when deleted
better dropdown (internally scrollable)
hide style settings when not in use
autoformat style names between react camelcase and css hyphens
more options for view type beyond p,h1,button

technical debt:

janky positioning of color picker
style data not all stored in main class, only in fragments
