The goal of this project is to provide a responsive webapp for creating CSS styles.
Major goals include:


-Allowing users to see a specified HTML element with different styles applied

-Allowing users to create styles without writing any CSS

-Allowing users to save CSS styles (by name) from the browser

-A comfortable interface for doing all of this






The current (very informal) to-do list is below:

create border style option

create border radius style option

set view text

UI padding

export CSS

save and name style settings

style settings don't reset when one is deleted

remove style when deleted

better dropdown (internally scrollable)

hide style settings when not in use

autoformat style names between react camelcase and css hyphens

more options for view type beyond p,h1,button


technical debt:

janky positioning of color picker

style data not all stored in main class, only in fragments
